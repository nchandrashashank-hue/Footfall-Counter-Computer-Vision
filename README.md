# Footfall-Counter-Computer-Vision
Dynamic People Counter using YOLOv8 and Supervision in Computer Vision


# 👣 Footfall Counter using Computer Vision

> **A real-time people detection and counting system powered by YOLOv8 and Supervision**

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

The **Footfall Counter** is an AI-based computer vision project that detects and counts people dynamically in a video feed.
It uses **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** for real-time object detection and **Supervision** for visualization and frame processing.
This project can be used in offices, malls, events, and other environments where tracking human presence is valuable.

## ✨ Key Features

✅ Real-time people detection using **YOLOv8**
✅ Dynamic counting of people per frame
✅ Bounding boxes with labels and live count overlay
✅ Optimized for **Google Colab** (runs on CPU or GPU)
✅ Accurate detection even in crowded environments

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚙️ Step 1: Open in Google Colab

Upload the notebook file into your Colab workspace:

```
Footfall_Counter_Shahshank.ipynb
```

### 📤 Step 2: Upload Your Video

Run all cells in order.
When prompted:

```
📤 Please upload your MP4 video file...
```

Upload your video file (e.g., `office.mp4`, `train.mp4`, etc.)

### 🎬 Step 3: Process & Download Output

After processing, the system will automatically generate and download:

```
people_dynamic_count.mp4
```

This video includes bounding boxes and a **live count of people** displayed in real-time.

Would you like me to add **badges (e.g., Python, YOLOv8, OpenCV, Colab)** at the top of the README for a professional open-source look? (It’ll look like icons with color labels — very eye-catching.)
